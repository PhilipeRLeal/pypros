Welcome to pyPROS's documentation!
==================================

Knowledge of surface precipitation type can be critical during
snow events at low altitudes or in regions not used to this phenomena.
For this purpose, previous studies developed several methodologies to 
discriminate precipitation types using meteorological surface observations.
Some of them are implemented in this package.
